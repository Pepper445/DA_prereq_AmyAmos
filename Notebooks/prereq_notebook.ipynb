    "I am excited to learn about possible careers with data analytics. I am interested in Salesforce, and I have a lot of experience with policy and procedure writing for business that want to accept clients with Kentucky State medicaid waivers. I'm hoping to use some of these skills to grow a career. I'm a single mom of six kids, their father left, so I am starting over later in life. Having no career age age 39 is not fun, and I am hoping to change my future."
